Detailed notebook covering:

🔹 Simple, Multiple & Polynomial Linear Regression

🔹 Mathematical intuition + step-by-step implementation

🔹 Visualizations to understand model behaviour

I’ve also added a full section on Regularization with clear explanations of all types:

🔸 Ridge (L2) – keeps weights smooth and stable

🔸 Lasso (L1) – performs automatic feature selection

🔸 ElasticNet (L1 + L2) – balances sparsity + stability

Each with their key understandings, formulas, examples, and code so beginners can connect the theory with intuition.

I’ve also included conclusions and links to three more notebooks inside this one, keeping everything connected for revision.

Hoping this is helpful to someone who’s learning or revising ML basics 🤍📚✨
